Calculator App (Kotlin):

This project is a simple Android calculator application developed using Kotlin. 
The main purpose of this app is to perform basic arithmetic calculations while helping beginners understand Android app development concepts such as UI handling, button click events, and logic implementation.
The application provides a clean and easy-to-use interface where users can enter numbers and perform calculations smoothly. It is suitable as a learning project for students who are starting with Android development using Kotlin.

Project Overview:

The Calculator App allows users to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can input numbers using on-screen buttons and view results instantly on the display area.
The project focuses on simplicity and clarity, making it easy to understand how user input is processed and how calculations are handled in Kotlin.

Features:

The application supports basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
It includes clear and delete options to reset or modify inputs.  
The user interface is simple, responsive, and easy to navigate.  
The app is lightweight and runs smoothly on Android devices.

Technologies Used:

This project is developed using Kotlin as the primary programming language.  
Android Studio is used as the development environment.  
Gradle is used for project build and dependency management.  
XML layouts are used to design the user interface.

How the Application Works:

The calculator works by capturing user input through button clicks. Each button press updates the display with numbers or operators. When the equals button is pressed, the app evaluates the entered expression and displays the calculated result. Clear and delete functions allow users to reset or correct their input easily.

Installation and Setup:

To run this project on your local system, follow these steps:
Clone the repository from GitHub using the following command: git clone https://github.com/pratyushraj1001/Calculator-App-Kotlin.git
Open the project in Android Studio.  
Let Gradle sync and build the project automatically.  
Run the application on an Android emulator or a physical device.

Future Improvements:

This project can be extended by adding advanced calculator features such as percentage calculations, scientific operations, calculation history, or a dark mode UI. Improving error handling and UI design can also enhance the overall user experience.

Conclusion:

This Calculator App is a beginner-friendly Android project that demonstrates the basics of Kotlin programming and Android UI development. It serves as a strong foundation for learning and building more advanced Android applications in the future.
